# Data Driven Discoveries: Analytics for Startup Success
### Project Objective: ###
**Customer: AI Startup Founder**

The goal of this project is to assist our customer in finding a skilled team. 
We will analyze a dataset containing profiles of individuals to identify the best candidates for the customer's startup. 
The individuals surveyed have diverse educational backgrounds spanning various fields and are enrolled in a generative AI course within an online AI program at Coursera. 
We are utilizing analytics tools to determine which individuals are most suited to join the customer's innovative venture.

### Files/Datasets: ###
**Cumulative_Activity_Form_Responses.csv**
   
This CSV file contains data from a Google Form survey targeting individuals interested in being hired for an AI startup. The survey captures the following information:

*Full Name:* The respondent's full name.

*Educational Background:* Indicates whether the respondent is an undergraduate, holds a Bachelor's degree, or a Master's degree.

*Academic Department:* The academic department with which the respondent is currently affiliated.

*Motivation for Learning Generative AI:* Reasons why the respondent is learning generative AI.

*Need for Online Career Support:* Whether the respondent needs online career support from the startup.

*Requirement for Online Learning Support in AI:* Whether the respondent requires online learning support in AI.

This dataset will be used to analyze and identify the best candidates for hiring based on their educational background, motivation, and support needs, using Python libraries: Pandas and Plotly.

### Executive summary: ### 
The data results indicate a strong interest in AI among **Undergraduate students from Information Technology and Web Development departments, as well as among Bachelor's degree holders from Business Management and Marketing departments**. These groups should be primary targets in the recruitment strategy.

The most popular academic departments among respondents are **Web Development, Computer Science, Software Development, Information Technology, and Business Management**, each with a Respondent Count of 4. This suggests a balanced interest in AI across both technical and business-oriented departments.

A significant majority of respondents **(approximately 65.2%)** expressed a need for online learning and career support in AI. This underscores the potential benefit of enhancing or introducing comprehensive online resources that cater to AI learning and career development.

The most common level of educational attainment among respondents interested in learning generative AI is evenly split between **Bachelor's degree holders and Undergraduates**, each with 8 respondents. This indicates that interest in generative AI spans different stages of higher education, with a slight emphasis on the undergraduate level and those who have completed a Bachelor's degree.

**Undergraduate students from Information Technology and Web Development** departments show an equal interest in AI, with a count of 2 respectively.

Bachelor's degree holders from Business Management and Marketing departments also demonstrate a similar interest in AI, each with a count of 2.

Only one Masters student each from Information Technology, Marketing, and Software Development departments are interested in AI.

One Undergraduate student each from Business Management and Computer Science departments show an interest in AI.

*<ins>The analytics task reveals the following:</ins>*

Among the respondents, the **most popular academic departments** are **Web Development, Computer Science, Software Development, Information Technology, and Business Management**, each with a Respondent Count of 4.

These departments are followed closely by Marketing, which has a Respondent Count of 3.

It's worth noting that **there is no single stand-out department**; the top five are equally popular.

The data does not show a clear preference for either technical (i.e., Web Development, Computer Science, Software Development, Information Technology) or business-oriented (i.e., Business Management, Marketing) departments.

Further analysis or more data might be needed to identify any significant differences or trends among the respondents' academic department choices.
